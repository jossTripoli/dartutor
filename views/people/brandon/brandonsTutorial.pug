                h2.ui.header Strong passwords are important!
                p.paragraph2 You'll need to create a password to do just about everything on the Web, from checking your email to online banking. And while it's simpler to use a short, easy-to-remember password, this can also pose serious risks to your online security. To protect yourself and your information, you'll want to use passwords that are long, strong, and difficult for someone else to guess while still keeping them relatively easy for you to remember.

                h2.ui.header Using a Password Manager
                p.paragraph2 Imagine a small, secure box where you can keep all your keys safe. Well, a password manager is like that for your online accounts. It helps you create strong and unique 'keys' (passwords) for each of your accounts, like email or banking. These 'keys' are complex and hard for bad people to guess. The manager keeps them locked up, so even if someone tries to break in, they can't get your 'keys.' You only need to remember one 'master key' to open this box and access all your 'keys' inside. It's like having a friendly helper to keep your online things safe and organized, making it easier and more secure when you use the internet.
